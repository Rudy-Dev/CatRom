[Repo]

* Proper documentation

[Spline]

* Store the quaternion x, y, z components as a Vector3?

[Future]

* Support modifying points (important for avoiding re-instantiating every frame)
* Support adding and removing points
* n-dimensional splines (already possible with vector CatRoms but annoying to do)
